# Jahf's Too Many 40K Minis

No selling done through this page, it's just a place to drop the content to show in Discord/Reddit/etc. 

## Background: 

All purchased between 1999 and 2003. See notes below for any *known* issues. Everything for each model has been photographed. 

I haven't broken things into individual prices. I'll feel lucky to resell these for the price I paid 20 years ago, so make an offer if you're willing to buy bulk (either for yourself, to split with friends, or to resell yourself).  If no interest in large offers I'll set up a price with the lists below, will just take a week or so. 

Photos are fairly high resolution, if looking for details (like on black primed models) try zooming in. 

## NOTES: 

1) I may have more but will need to find them (noise marines, thousand sons, doomrider)

2) If this goes to individual models, please note if you **prefer** lead or white metal ... but for now no promises on either

3) Specific names/terminology may be off, it's been awhile :)

# Quick listing of each sheet:

## Chaos: 

* Of note: Chaos Squat Terminators and Marines (lead), Original Juggernaut (lead), Rogue Trader era corrupted Marines (and a squad of beakies) and some fantasy models for Sorcerors
* "RT-era" = Rogue Trader era designs
* "2e" = 2nd edition design (only noting this when it might get confusing)
* Mix of plastic (dark flat), lead (darker metallic) and "white metal" (pewter) model ... duplicates often are 1 white metal and 1 lead
* Many not pictured with backpacks but DO have Chaos backpacks to go with them (2 designs, fat plastic only and narrow in mostly plastic but some metal)
* Unless pictured, Chaos minis have no slotta bases included
* Most are never-painted, some were painted but stripped, a few retain a base coat (always GW primers)


NOTE: These will go in order by [row],[column] where logical, top-left is column 1 / row 5, bottom-right is column 8 / row 5.

## Necrons:

* Of note: Monolith, C'Tan Deceiver x 2 (1 sealed, 2nd missing 1 piece of head), C'Tan Nightbringer, Destroyer Lord, 4 Heavy Destroyers, Scarab metal bases
* These are the 2nd run of Necrons, mostly plastic, otherwise white metal
* None have ever been assembled or painted ... I started sprue removal on warriors then never came back to it
* I have some of the original boxes where shown. These will sell with their listed contents (transfer sheets may be wrong, see below)
* I have 6 decal transfer sheets + 1 dedicated to the Monolith box. I didn't put sheets in photos with what they'll ship with, I'll note that in descriptions. Given their age and decal nature, no promises on usefulness but all are in very good condition. 


* The rest of these photos are ***Necrons*** and do not have row/columns. 
* These are the *2nd* round of Necrons, the very very original pre-Codex Necrons were lead and looked very different
* Where sprues are stacked for fitting in frame they are identical sprues in each stack, with 1 sprue shown separately so you can zoom in for content detail

---

### Sheet G - Necron Warriors + Scarabs box

* 12 plastic Necron warriors on sprue
* 3 sets of 4 scarabs for swarms with posts shown
* Bases for all
* Transparent Green cannon tubes on sprue

* Box included, condition shown
* Will include ***1*** decal transfer sheet


---

### Sheets H1/H2/H3 - Necron Battle Force box

* 12 plasticNecron warriors on sprue
* 3 Destroyers (with unused clear bases and posts)
* 5 sets of 4 scarabs for swarms with posts shown
* Bases for all
* Transparent Green cannon tubes on sprue

* Box included, condition shown
* Will include ***4*** decal transfer sheets

---

### Sheet I - Necron Destroyers / Heavy Destroyers / Destroyer Lord

* 2 Destroyers (identical to the 3 in the Battle Force box)
* 3 Heavy Destroyers (identical to Destroyer + extra pieces, see "nubby" note below)
* 1 Destroyer Lord (identical to Destroyer + extra pieces)
* Clear bases and posts (unused) for all)
* Transparent Green rods on sprue (1 fell off, shown, but still included)
	
* No carboard boxes (but do have plastic shell containers for the Heavies & Lord)
* Will include ***2*** decal transfer sheets

* "Nubby" note ... 
* The Heavy Destroyers come with the "nubby" pieces shown far-right bottom ... but ... 
* the 2 left Heavies only had 1 "nubby"
	* the far right has 2 "nubby" pieces
	* the Lord had none 
	* ... I'm not sure what the right combination for this bit are as I can't see where it even goes
	* ... if the Lord should have one and the far right Heavy should only have 1, I can fix that before shipping, but speak up

* Destroyer bases shown on top DO have the bottom pieces in the photo, I just forgot to show them separated except for the one for the Destroyer Lord on the right. 
* The Destroyer body on left was removed from sprue as shown, rest are on sprue
* There are 3 Heavy Destroyers, one on the far right. The one second from the right is the Lord kit (I found the extra Heavy after taking the photo, which is why this is multiple photos combined)
		
---

### Sheet J - Necron Scarabs

* Top-right - 10 Scarab swarms (4 scarabs + posts + base)
* 4 swarms without bases *shown* but do have 4 bases from the next sheet to be complete swarms
	
* Left - Scarab -base- pieces
* These are used for some of the Necron character models. 
	* I planned to use them for creating swarms that were more resistant to post damage (the little plastic posts can be finicky)
	* Clear bits are just leftovers from other sprues and would be possibly useful for using in a conversion
	* These weren't sold like this, they were bought as a catalog bitz order
	* Could be used with the 4 swarms shown without bases for a big swarm
		
---

### Sheet K - Necron C'Tan & Wraiths

* Left-top - C'tan Nightbringer (only have what is shown but looks complete including a quartz-y base piece)
* Middle-top - C'tan Deceiver still in sealed box
* Right-top - C'tan Deceiver (*missing* the right-side head spikes, where the red circle shows, but should be easy to greenstuff sculpt based on right half ... I bought this one like this then lucked into the sealed box)
* Bottom-left - 10 swarm/c'tan sized bases (14 shown but 4 reserved for the 4 swarms on Sheet J)
* Bottom-right - 3 Necron Wraiths
* Middle-far-right - 3 "extra" transparent green gun tubes ... bits but reserved in case the other sheets are missing some
	
---

### Sheet L - Necron Warriors

* 36 Necron Warriors (3 rows of 12 still on sprue)
* Bases and transparent green rods
* SAME as the ones in the box on Sheet G except:
* no box
	* no scarab swarms
* This is likely from 3 more Warrior boxes, which would have included 9 of the Scarabs from Sheet Juggernaut
	
---

### Sheets M1/M2/M3 - Necron Monolith

* Includes box in condition shown (looks rough but still holds together)
* Intructions printed on inside sides of box, shown
* Based on instructions I believe all parts still here
* I did some gently flash removal from pieces long ago before storing
* An extra 4 small green plastic rods (abovethe 8 the instructions call for) were in this box, leaving here as spares, pictured
* Includes **1** decal transfer sheet
	
---

### Sheet N - Necron Decal Transfer Sheets

* These aren't being sold separately, just pictured here to show they're in good conditions. 1 is also included in the Monolith, shown on it's sheets (had to take this last shot with a cell phone camera as I forgot to take it earlier). 


---

### Sheet O - Necron Flayed Ones

* 12 Flayed Ones
* Also forgot to take a photo in the original set, so this is from cellphone, it's blurry ... they were first run casts and are much crisper than shown. 
	
---

### Print Materials (no pictures/listing yet):

* All in good or better condition, but none mint ... little use, mostly just some folded corners from moving / storing
* Rogue Trader manual (softback)
* Many White Dwarf issues around 250-300
* 2nd edition Chaos / Necron codexes (mostly softback)
* GW Catalog including old models from <>2002
* (will photo and inventory these in a week, making sure they stay flat while transitioning from storage to house)
